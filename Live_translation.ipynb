    "## Real-Time Speech Translation (Streaming Demo)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a minimal real-time speech translation pipeline built using open-source speech recognition and machine translation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis here is on **streaming behavior** rather than offline accuracy. Audio is processed incrementally, partial transcriptions are generated as speech arrives, and translations are updated continuously. This setup reflects the constraints of real-world speech translation systems, where models operate on incomplete and evolving context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is intentionally simple and self-contained so that the end-to-end behavior—buffering, latency, and hypothesis updates—can be inspected and modified easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope and assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speech input is assumed to be in **English**\n",
    "- Translation is performed into a selected Indic language\n",
    "- Transcription and translation operate on partial audio segments\n",
    "- Latency is influenced by network conditions and model inference time.\n",
    "- Running in a Colab environment imposes constraints that limit the extent of streaming optimizations."
